**Grade: 78 / 80**

**Overall Comments**

- Very impressive work — really well done!
- An innovative idea and combination of different analysis techniques
- Strong technical execution and visuals!

# Grading

- **Concept (15/15)**:
  - **Criteria**
    - Is it sufficiently complex/challenging/sophisticated?
    - Is the final product useful/interesting/creative?
  - **Comments**
    - Really well thought out design
    - Serves as a very interesting case study / prototype for future research to build off

* **Technical implementation (25/25)**:

  - **Criteria**
    - Was it well thought out?
    - Was each step done correctly?
    - Does it satisfy 2 of the guidelines listed below?
  - **Comments**
    - Overall very strong
    - Great application of analysis techniques and packages relevant to research question

- **Visualization (23/25)**:
  - **Criteria**
    - How well does the data visualization serve its purpose?
    - Does it tell a clear story?
    - Are the colors/layout/titles well-chosen?
  - **Comments**
    - Great choice of visuals — simple and effective and illustrating the problem at hand and results.
    - One note: You can re-order the blog posts by manually adjusting the dates of the posts (in the file name and in the header). Posts are shown in reverse chronological order. This way you can have the intro first and results last on the main page.
    - Aesthetics of final seaborn heatmaps coud be improved — labels for the quantity being plotted and formatting the numbers would help communicate the takeaways

* **Writeup (15/15)**:
  - **Criteria**
    - Is all of the above explained clearly?
    - Does the 1-2 page writeup explain in depth all aspects of the project's implementation and final results?
  - **Comments**
    - Great writeup — clear and concise

# Guidelines

The project is open-ended. The topic and technologies used are up to you.
However, the it must satisfy **at least two of the items below**:

- Data is collected through a means more sophisticated than downloading (e.g. scraping, API).
- At least one of the datasets contains more than 1,000,000 rows.
- It combines data collected from 3 or more different sources.
- The analysis of the data is reasonably complex, involving multiple steps
  (geospatial joins/operations, data shaping, data frame operations, etc).
- You use one of the analysis techniques for urban street networks (e.g., osmnx, pandana), clustering (e.g., scikit-learn), or raster datasets
- You perform a machine learning analysis with scikit-learn as part of the analysis.
- The webpage includes a significant interactive component (cross-filtering, interactive widgets, etc)
